        Erik Ibarra wants to live in a world of ice cream, with different flavors, toppings, and the presentation. </strong>
    </p>

    <p> <strong> As an Animation Director, he has been <br>
        showcased on CANVAS and on his portfolio. </strong> </p>
    
    <p> <strong> When he is not working out and staying fit, <br>
        you can find Erik Ibarra's greatest achievement on creating video game designs and animation projects either by himself or with different people, <br> 
        and helping them on completing their tasks.</strong> </p>
  
    <p> <strong>His latest project is Nemo and hits an inbox near you on December 2, 2026. </strong></p>

    <p><strong> His work on coding will be used to show and explain the people that wanna start the journey to coding at CANVAS. </strong> </p>
