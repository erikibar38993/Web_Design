        <h3> My Journey</h3>
        <p> For over 2 decades, I have experienced many amazing events and inventions, personal and public memories.
            From the good times and the sad times. There have been moments that gave me powerful emotions. My brain is filled
            with those moments, some are detailed, others are vague, but once I see it. I'll remember it one way or another. 
        </p>
