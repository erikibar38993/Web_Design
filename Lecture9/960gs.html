        <h3> My Journey</h3> <br>
        <section>
        <p> For over 2 decades, I have experienced many amazing events and inventions, personal and public memories.
            From the good times and the sad times. There have been moments that gave me powerful emotions. My brain is filled
            with those moments, some are detailed, others are vague, but once I see it. I'll remember it one way or another.

        <p> I used to play a lot of the Call of Duty franchise and the different installments, while I do not play them anymore,
            I still remember how I played and chatted with some of my comapnions during my childhood. While offline, I tend to play Pokemon
            games, which was a passtime on missions and objectives. Taking hours, patience, and my confidence to be tested.

        <h3>Animation</h3> <br>
        <section>
        <p> With the game Pokemon, I did enjoyed the animation shows that they created. After growing up I started to watch more animation shows 
            of different ratings. My favorite one is Fairy Tail, it was the first one that I enjoyed a show that is mainstream. From different sites to 
            Youtube. I have watched a lot of youtube videos, different content creators, many themes and topics. It has been with me since the 
            start of the iPod. Watch to doze off, to make me happy, sometimes to make me sad. It gave tons of emotions and memories. There are many things that I cherished,
            but this is only a layer of the surface. Also, this also lead me to pursue Animation and Game Desing Career, as well a career on Video Arts .</p>
