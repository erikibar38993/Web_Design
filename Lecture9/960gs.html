        <h3> My Journey</h3>
        <p> For over 2 decades, I have experienced many amazing events and inventions, personal and public memories.
            From the good times and the sad times. There have been moments that gave me powerful emotions. My brain is filled
            with those moments, some are detailed, others are vague, but once I see it. I'll remember it one way or another.

        <h3>The Aside Section</h3>
        <p>
            The aside can represent secondary content outside of an article, 
            that is considered secondary to the main content in the article. 
           to the content of the article.</p>
        <p> Although it may look like a sidbar in the sense of a navigational widget,
             it is always wise to use the nav element instead of an aside when you would like to place additional navigational elements.</p>
