        <p>Etsy is a website, like Ebay, a marketplace where millions of people can search, buy, or sell items from other people. <br>
            The colors and the palletes of the website's contrast is easy to see, but it a good example of having contrast.</p> <br>

        <ul>
            <li>When clicking on the link, you are greated with a light pink with white of the website, which can sometimes bring colors of joy, <br>
                 happiness, calm, and ha . </li> <br> <br> <br>

 <h2> Repetition </h2>

 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com"> Steam Website </a> <br> 
     <img src="colmun_steam_01-1024x823.jpeg"  width="800" height="800">  <br>
        <p> There have been many websites on buying video games, Steam has been more on a specififc console, which is PC, personal computer, gaming. <br>
            Steam develops and releases games digitally, they have a community to have discussions about gaming topics, as well they also create hand <br>
            held consoles to use while gaming on their PC. Their website does have a good way to see repetition. </p>
          <ol>
              <li> Most of the fonts are organized and placed in the same areas, repeating the professionalism of company. </li> <br>
              <li>Each section of the website has the same sizes of each moving picture, a pattern that keeps repeating.</li> <br>
         </ol>

<h2>Alignment </h2>     
     <a href = "https://unity.com"> Unity Website </a> <br>
        <p> Unity is a studio company that creates and design products such as video games and animation by 3D, they also managed to expand <br>
            outside of software, and create architectural and transportation design with the Unity software. The alignment of this company's <br>
            website is well professional and organized, that it needs to be on my alignment list. </p>
    <img src="unity1pci"  width="600" height="500">  <img src="unity2"  width="600" height="500">  <br> 
    <img src="unity3pic"  width="600" height="500">  <img src="unityPic"  width="600" height="500">  <br>
        <li>Each section has alignment of their items and the products that they selling, while it is a bit of promximity, the space between each boxes are symmetrical.</li> <br>
        <li> There are no boxes or items that are not too connected with the eges around the corner. </li> <br> 
      </ol>
     
<h2> Proximity </h2>       
 
<a href = "https://www.adultswim.com"> Adult Swim Website </a>
         <dl>
             <p>Adult Swim has been a company that is very well known in the animation and tv show industry. <br>
                 While people assume that the company just releases raunchy and adult shows with heavy language <br>
                 and violence and other mature content, it is actually not that, they are creative and make shows that <br>
                 are mellow, calm, or highly intensed, and enjoyable shows, when going into their website, their style <br>
                 on how they created is a great example of repetition. </p>
        <img src="ASpicIntro"  width="600" height="500">  <img src="ASpic2"  width="600" height="500">  <br>

            <dt>REASON #1 </dt>
            <dd> Each sections has its own design and format, giving their own uniqueness, but still be connected to each sections. </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>REASON #2</dt>
            <dd> The fonts of each sections are different from one another, making it less generic and being more creative </dd> 
            <br>
